3. Diff. between  <input type="submit"  />   and <button></button>  ?

<input type=”button” /> buttons will not submit a form – they don’t do anything by default.
They’re generally used in conjunction with JavaScript as part of an AJAX application.

<input type=”submit”> buttons will submit the form they are in when the user clicks on them, unless you specify otherwise with JavaScript.
