Q:  What is difference between get/post methods in form tag?

>>>POST
>The completed form field entries are sent within the body of the http request.
>This allows the collected form entry data to be whatever size. Ideal if there’s a lot of data collection involving free form content areas.
>However, because there is no change to the URL from the field entries, there isn’t the page variations to bookmark.
>Allows the submission of binary data, for example the uploading of images.
>With this approach the completed field entries are retained on the page, making it secure.

>>>GET
>This is the default form method. Without specifying the form method in the form tag it will be assumed to be of method type get.
>With the get method the form data is more visible.
>The fields and their values are passed in the URL as name+value querystring parameters
>less secure

Q:  What is querystring? 

>The QueryString collection is used to retrieve the variable values in the HTTP query string.
>The HTTP query string is specified by the values following the question mark (?), 
	like this:<a href= "test.asp?txt=this is a query string test">Link with a query string</a>
>The line above generates a variable named txt with the value "this is a query string test".
>Query strings are also generated by form submission, or by a user typing a query into the address bar of the browser.
