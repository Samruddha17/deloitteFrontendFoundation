1.  What is JSON?  

> JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
> JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
> JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
> JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties.
> A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value
> It is easy to structure the data compare to XML.
> It supports data structures like arrays and objects and the JSON documents that are rapidly executed on the server.


2.  What is HTTP Status codes?

> An HTTP status code is a server response to a browser’s request.
> When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the site’s server, and the server then responds to the browser’s request with a three-digit code: the HTTP status code.
> These status codes are the Internet equivalent of a conversation between your browser and the server. 
> They communicate whether things between the two are A-okay, touch-and-go, or whether something is wrong.
> The Status-Code element in a server response, is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role.
> 1xx: Informational : It means the request has been received and the process is continuing.
> 2xx: Success : It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
> 3xx: Redirection : It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
> 4xx: Client Error : It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
> 5xx: Server Error : It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

3.  What is the meaning of 500 Status codes?

> 5xx: Server Error means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
> The request was not completed. The server met an unexpected condition.

4.  What is No-Sql Databases?

> NoSQL Database is used to refer a non-SQL or non relational database.
> It provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data other than tabular relations model used in relational databases.
> NoSQL database doesn't use tables for storing data. It is generally used to store big data and real-time web applications.
> It supports query language.
> It provides fast performance.
> It provides horizontal scalability.
